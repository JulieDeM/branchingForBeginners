# branchingForBeginners

###to start, fork this repository to your github account
###clone this repository to your machine using your preferred cloning method
let's start by editing a file that already exists. in the index.html file, go ahead and make some sort of change. maybe add a link to your favorite youtube video or a paragraph about something you enjoy.
###in your terminal go ahead and add, commit (don't forget your commit message!), and push those changes up to github
####since you're only working on your fork of this repo, you won't need to pull any changes down before you push, but we'll talk more about pushing later!
###now that your changes have been pushed to the repository, let's create a new file. it can be whatever you'd like. maybe add a stylesheet for index.html. you don't need to add to much to it, but make sure you link it to your index page.
after you've added some styling (it doesn't have to be much), add, commit, and push those changes up.
###now for the fun part: branching!
to create a new branch type the command `$ git checkout -b branchName` into your terminal. the `-b` flag is a shortcut for `$ git branch branchName` `$ git checkout branchName`
